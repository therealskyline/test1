        <p>
            Welcome to the Anime Zone documentation! This guide explains how to add new anime, seasons, and episodes to the platform.

        <h2>Data Structure</h2>
        <p>
            All anime data is stored in <code>static/data/anime.json</code>. This file contains an array of anime objects,
            each with their own properties and nested arrays for seasons and episodes.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Add New Content</h2>
        
        <h3>Adding a New Anime</h3>
        <p>
            To add a new anime, you need to add a new object to the <code>anime</code> array in the JSON file.
            Make sure to give it a unique ID and include all the required fields.
        </p>
        <pre>
// Example of adding a new anime
{
  "id": 21,  // Make sure this is unique
  "title": "New Anime Title",
  "description": "This is a description of the new anime.",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "genres": ["action", "comedy"],
  "rating": 8.7,
  "featured": false,
  "seasons": [
    {
      "season_number": 1,
      "episodes": [
        {
          "episode_number": 1,
          "title": "First Episode",
          "description": "This is the first episode.",
          "video_url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing"

        <h3>Adding a New Season to an Existing Anime</h3>

            To add a new season, find the anime in the JSON file and add a new object to its <code>seasons</code> array.
        </p>
        <pre>
// Find the anime by its ID and add a new season
{
  "season_number": 2,  // Make sure this is the next season number
  "episodes": [
    {
      "episode_number": 1,

}</pre>
        
        <h3>Adding a New Episode to an Existing Season</h3>

            To add a new episode, find the anime and season in the JSON file, and add a new object to the season's <code>episodes</code> array.
        </p>
        <pre>
// Find the anime and season, then add a new episode

        <h2>Example: Complete Workflow</h2>
        <p>Here's a complete example of how to add a new anime with multiple seasons and episodes:</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Create the Anime Object</h3>
        <pre>
{
  "id": 21,
  "title": "Dragon Hunter",
  "description": "A young warrior embarks on a journey to hunt dragons and save his village.",
  "image": "https://example.com/dragon-hunter.jpg",
  "genres": ["action", "fantasy", "adventure"],
  "rating": 8.9,
  "featured": true,
  "seasons": []
}</pre>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Add the First Season</h3>
        <pre>
"seasons": [
  {
    "season_number": 1,
    "episodes": []
  }
]</pre>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Add Episodes to the Season</h3>
        <pre>
"episodes": [
  {
    "episode_number": 1,
    "title": "The Beginning",
    "description": "Ryu discovers his destiny as a dragon hunter when his village is attacked.",
    "video_url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing"
  },
  {
    "episode_number": 2,
    "title": "Training Begins",
    "description": "Ryu starts his training under a veteran dragon hunter.",
    "video_url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing"
  }
]</pre>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Add the Complete Object to the JSON File</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, add the complete anime object to the <code>anime</code> array in the JSON file.
            Make sure to place it inside the array and use proper JSON formatting with commas between objects.
